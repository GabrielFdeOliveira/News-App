First part:
1- Check the API documentation
2- Initialize the app
3- Think about the component tree
4- Build the file structure

Decided to use Vite over "Create React App" as it is faster to initialize and run.
I believe I'll need only three components for this application.
To avoid specificity complicts I'll use css modules from the start.

Second part:
1- Fetch the API data (Axios).
2- Store the data in a useState.
3- Render the data.
4- Add an input field to search by term.
5- Style the Card component
