# Percayso Tech Test

This is my solution to a problem provided by Percayso, here they asked me to create a website that gets news from the GNews api, and this website should:

- Include a search area.
- Include a results area.
- Include tests.
- Be hosted on a publicly accessible URL.

## Lessons Learned

It can be challenging for me to navigate prop management and determine which components should store specific states. However, testing is what has taught me more in this task, although I still have a long way to go. I enjoy this aspect of development and am eager to continue improving.

I'm a 33-year-old Brazilian who is making a career change from the automotive industry to technology. I have a beautiful relationship with feedback, It helped me improve my English skills and I believe it will continue to serve me well in the tech industry!

When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying active through workouts, gaming, exploring the beauty of the British countryside, or simply observing birds in nature.
